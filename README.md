# Ignite Call

Ignite call is a scheduling website  made using `Next.js`.

After creating your account and connecting to Google Calendar, you can share your profile link so that people can see in a calendar the days and times available to schedule an event with you. After marking a data, the schedule will already be in your Google Calendar.

The project has features such as user registration in a database, social login, data manipulation and `Google API` consumption.

To start the project you must:

```
npm install
```
```
npm run dev
```
